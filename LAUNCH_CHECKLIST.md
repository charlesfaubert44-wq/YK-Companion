## üí° MY RECOMMENDATION

**Goal:** Launch in 8 weeks
**Budget:** $5,000-$10,000 (outsource payments & email)
**Focus:** Get 5 sponsors before building everything
**Strategy:** Launch lean, iterate based on real users

**You have a great foundation. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Launch Phase 1, get users, then build what they actually need!**

---

**Questions?** Review COMPLETE_ROADMAP.md for all details.

**Ready to start?** Begin with Stripe integration - it's the most critical piece.

**Need help?** Consider hiring a developer for payments/email, then DIY the rest.

**Launch target:** 8 weeks from today! üöÄ
