GARAGE SALES PAGE SYNTAX FIX - COMPLETED
==========================================

FILE: apps/web/src/app/living/garage-sales/page.tsx

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Lines 364-454 contained duplicate/conflicting code from a bad merge
- TWO map view sections were defined
- Incorrectly placed closing tags and malformed ternary operators
- Build failures due to syntax errors

ISSUES REMOVED:
1. Removed duplicate Map View code block (original lines 424-454)
2. Removed malformed ternary operator remnant (original lines 394-407)
   - This had: ") : ( filteredSales.map(..." which was leftover from merge
3. Removed extra closing brace/parenthesis pairs that broke nesting

FINAL STRUCTURE (CORRECT):
Line 312:     <div> Main Content Container
Line 314-331:     Add/Edit Form Modal
Line 333-362:     List View (viewMode === 'list')
Line 364-394:     Map View (viewMode === 'map')
Line 396-409:     Calendar View (viewMode === 'calendar')
Line 410:     </div> Close Main Content
Line 411:     </div> Close Container
Line 412:     </div> Close Page Wrapper
Line 413:     </> Close Fragment

VALIDATION RESULTS:
✓ All braces balanced (no extra/missing {})
✓ All brackets balanced (no extra/missing [])
✓ All parentheses balanced (no extra/missing ())
✓ Only ONE Map View section (line 365)
✓ Only ONE Calendar View section (line 397)
✓ Only ONE List View section (line 334)
✓ Proper JSX nesting hierarchy verified
✓ No syntax errors detected

STATUS: FIXED - File now compiles without syntax errors
