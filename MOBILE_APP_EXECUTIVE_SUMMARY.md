# YK Buddy Mobile App - Executive Summary

**One-page overview for decision makers**

---

## The Opportunity

Transform YK Buddy into **native iOS and Android apps** that reach users where they are - on their phones, with push notifications, offline access, and native performance.

---

## What We're Building

**Mobile apps for both platforms:**
- iOS (Apple App Store)
- Android (Google Play Store)

**Technology:** Expo + React Native (write once, deploy to both platforms)

**Timeline:** 16 weeks from start to app store submission

---

## Why Mobile Apps?

### Problems Mobile Solves

1. **Low Engagement** - Users forget to check the website
   - **Solution:** Push notifications for aurora alerts and garage sales

2. **Offline Access** - Yellowknife has spotty cell service
   - **Solution:** Full offline mode with cached data

3. **Discovery** - Hard to find via web search
   - **Solution:** App Store presence and discoverability

4. **User Experience** - Mobile web is clunky
   - **Solution:** Native mobile UX with gestures and smooth animations

### Mobile Advantages

âœ… **Push Notifications** - "Aurora visible tonight! KP 6"
âœ… **Offline Mode** - Works without internet
âœ… **App Store Presence** - Searchable in stores
âœ… **Better Engagement** - App icon on home screen
âœ… **Native Features** - Camera, GPS, biometric login
âœ… **Faster Performance** - No page reloads

## Technical Feasibility

### What's Already Done âœ…

1. **Expo scaffold exists** - Basic mobile app structure in place
2. **Backend ready** - Supabase works for both web and mobile
3. **All features built** - Everything exists in web app already
4. **Monorepo structure** - Ready for shared code

### What Needs to be Built ðŸ”¨

1. **Convert React components** - Web â†’ React Native
2. **Mobile UI/UX** - Optimize for touch/gestures
3. **Push notifications** - Set up Expo Notifications
4. **Offline caching** - React Query + AsyncStorage
5. **App Store assets** - Screenshots, descriptions, etc.

### Risk Assessment: LOW âœ…

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **App store rejection** | Follow guidelines strictly, test thoroughly |
| **Technical limitations** | Expo handles most native features |
| **Development delays** | Detailed 16-week plan with milestones |
| **Cost overruns** | Fixed-price or in-house development |

## Questions?

### Technical Questions
