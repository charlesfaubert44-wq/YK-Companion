## Design Patterns Used

All pages follow consistent patterns:

**Authentication Check:**
```tsx
const { user, profile, loading } = useAuth();

if (!user) {
  router.push('/auth/login');
  return;
}
```

**Loading State:**
```tsx
if (loading) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />;
}
```

**Authorization Gate:**
```tsx
if (!isVerified) {
  return <VerificationRequiredScreen />;
}
```

**Aurora Theme:**
- Gradient backgrounds: `from-northern-midnight via-dark-900`
- Glassmorphic cards: `backdrop-blur-xl bg-dark-900/95`
- Aurora colors: `aurora-green`, `aurora-blue`, `aurora-purple`, `aurora-pink`
- Smooth animations: `animate-in fade-in slide-in-from-bottom`

---

## Accessibility Features

All pages include:
- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus states on all interactive elements
- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA)
- Mobile-friendly touch targets (44px minimum)
