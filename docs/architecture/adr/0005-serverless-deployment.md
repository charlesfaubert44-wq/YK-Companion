# ADR-0005: Deploy on Vercel Serverless Platform

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-01-16
**Decision Makers:** Development Team
**Impact:** High

---

## Context

We need a hosting solution for YK Buddy that provides:

- **Next.js Optimization** - First-class Next.js support
- **Global CDN** - Fast content delivery worldwide
- **Automatic Scaling** - Handle traffic spikes
- **Zero DevOps** - No server management
- **CI/CD Integration** - Automatic deployments
- **Cost Effective** - Free tier for MVP
- **Preview Deployments** - Test PRs before merging

### Requirements

1. **Performance** - Fast page loads globally
2. **Scalability** - Handle growth without manual intervention
3. **Developer Experience** - Easy deployments, fast iterations
4. **Budget** - $0 during MVP phase
5. **Reliability** - High uptime (99.9%+)
6. **Security** - HTTPS, DDoS protection, edge security

### Current Situation

- Next.js 14 application with API routes
- Small team (1-2 developers)
- No DevOps expertise
- Limited budget (~$0-50/month)
- Need to launch quickly (3-4 months)

---

## Decision

**We will deploy YK Buddy on Vercel's serverless platform** with:

- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Serverless functions for API routes
- Global edge network (CDN)
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Free tier for MVP, scale to Pro if needed

### Deployment Model

```
GitHub → Vercel Build → Global Edge Network
   ↓           ↓              ↓
 Push       Build         Serve Globally
            Test          (70+ locations)
           Deploy
```

### Approach

1. **GitHub Integration** - Connect repository to Vercel
2. **Automatic Builds** - Deploy on push to main branch
3. **Preview Deployments** - Unique URL for each PR
4. **Environment Variables** - Managed in Vercel dashboard
5. **Edge Network** - Static assets served from edge
6. **Serverless Functions** - API routes run on-demand
7. **Custom Domain** - Future: ykbuddy.com

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: AWS (EC2 + ECS/EKS)

**Description:** Self-managed servers on AWS

**Pros:**
- Full control over infrastructure
- Mature platform with many services
- Can optimize for specific needs
- Good for complex architectures

**Cons:**
- Requires DevOps expertise
- Complex setup (VPCs, load balancers, security groups)
- Manual scaling and monitoring
- Higher costs (EC2 instances 24/7)
- Long learning curve
- Time-consuming maintenance

**Why not chosen:** Team lacks DevOps expertise. Don't want to manage servers. Too complex for our needs.

### Alternative 2: Netlify

**Description:** Similar serverless platform to Vercel

**Pros:**
- Great static site hosting
- Generous free tier
- Good developer experience
- Form handling, functions
- Split testing built-in

**Cons:**
- Next.js support not as good as Vercel
- Serverless functions more limited
- Edge functions in beta
- Smaller edge network than Vercel
- Build times can be slower

**Why not chosen:** Vercel has better Next.js support (they make Next.js). First-class SSR and ISR support.

### Alternative 3: AWS Amplify

**Description:** AWS's JAMstack platform

**Pros:**
- Good AWS integration
- Supports Next.js SSR
- Free tier available
- Built-in auth (Cognito)

**Cons:**
- Slower builds than Vercel
- Less intuitive interface
- Complex configuration
- Tied to AWS ecosystem
- Preview deployments not as good

**Why not chosen:** Developer experience not as good as Vercel. Build times slower. More complex setup.

### Alternative 4: DigitalOcean App Platform

**Description:** Managed app hosting on DigitalOcean

**Pros:**
- Simple pricing
- Good documentation
- Managed databases
- Predictable costs

**Cons:**
- No free tier (starts at $5/month)
- Smaller edge network
- Less Next.js optimization
- Fewer regions than Vercel
- Limited serverless features

**Why not chosen:** No free tier. Vercel has better Next.js support and global edge network.

### Alternative 5: Self-hosted (Docker + VPS)

**Description:** Deploy Docker container on VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.)

**Pros:**
- Full control
- Predictable costs ($5-10/month)
- Can host multiple apps
- Good for learning Docker

**Cons:**
- Must manage server, OS, security
- Manual scaling
- No global CDN
- Must handle SSL certificates
- Requires DevOps skills
- Single point of failure

**Why not chosen:** Too much operational overhead. Want to focus on features, not infrastructure.

### Alternative 6: Cloudflare Pages

**Description:** Cloudflare's serverless platform

**Pros:**
- Excellent CDN (Cloudflare network)
- Free tier
- Good DDoS protection
- Fast edge network
- Workers for functions

**Cons:**
- Next.js SSR support limited
- Primarily for static sites
- Serverless functions (Workers) different model
- Less mature than Vercel for Next.js
- More complex configuration

**Why not chosen:** Best for static sites. Next.js SSR support not as mature as Vercel.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Zero DevOps** - No servers to manage
- **Instant Deploys** - Push to deploy in minutes
- **Global Performance** - CDN in 70+ locations
- **Automatic Scaling** - Handles traffic spikes automatically
- **Preview Deployments** - Test changes before merging
- **HTTPS by Default** - SSL certificates automatic
- **DDoS Protection** - Edge network protects against attacks
- **Edge Caching** - Fast content delivery worldwide
- **Analytics Built-in** - Core Web Vitals tracking
- **Great DX** - Excellent developer experience
- **Free Tier Generous** - 100GB bandwidth/month free

### Negative Consequences

- **Vendor Lock-in** - Tightly coupled to Vercel
- **Cold Starts** - Serverless functions have cold start latency
- **Function Limits** - 10s timeout on Hobby, 60s on Pro
- **Cost at Scale** - Can get expensive beyond free tier
- **Limited Control** - Can't customize server environment
- **Bandwidth Costs** - $0.15/GB over free tier
- **Build Minutes** - Limited on free tier (6000 min/month)

### Risks

- **Exceeding Free Tier** - Bandwidth/build minutes may exceed limits
  - *Mitigation:* Monitor usage, optimize assets, budget for Pro ($20/month)

- **Vendor Lock-in** - Difficult to migrate off Vercel
  - *Mitigation:* Next.js can deploy elsewhere (Netlify, AWS, Docker)

- **Cold Starts** - API routes may have latency on first request
  - *Mitigation:* Optimize functions, consider Pro tier (less cold starts)

- **Function Timeouts** - Long-running operations may timeout
  - *Mitigation:* Use background jobs, webhooks, or separate worker service

## Implementation

### Setup Process

1. **Connect GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   # Link Vercel to GitHub repo
   vercel link
   ```

2. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Build Command: `npm run build:web`
   - Output Directory: `apps/web/.next`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxx
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=xxx (keep secret)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=xxx
   ```

4. **Configure Deployment**
   - Production Branch: `main`
   - Preview Branches: All branches
   - Auto-deploy: Enabled

### Deployment Configuration

**vercel.json:**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd apps/web && npm run build",
  "devCommand": "cd apps/web && npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "regions": ["iad1"],
  "functions": {
    "apps/web/src/app/api/**": {
      "memory": 1024,
      "maxDuration": 10
    }
  }
}
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

```
1. Developer pushes to branch
   ↓
2. Vercel detects push via webhook
   ↓
3. Vercel creates preview deployment
   ↓
4. Build runs (install, build, test)
   ↓
5. Preview URL generated
   ↓
6. Comment added to PR with URL
   ↓
7. PR merged to main
   ↓
8. Production deployment triggered
   ↓
9. Health checks pass
   ↓
10. Traffic switches to new deployment
```

### Performance Optimization

- **Static Generation** - Generate static pages at build time
- **ISR** - Incremental Static Regeneration for dynamic content
- **Image Optimization** - Next.js Image component with Vercel optimization
- **Edge Caching** - Static assets cached at edge
- **Compression** - Brotli compression enabled
- **HTTP/2** - Multiplexing enabled
