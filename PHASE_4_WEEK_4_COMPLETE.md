- Avoids COUNT queries
- Maintained via triggers
- Shows popularity

### 3. Optimistic UI Updates
FavoriteButton updates UI immediately:
- Better perceived performance
- Reverts on error
- Smooth user experience

### 4. Component Composition
Reusable FavoriteButton component:

## 💡 Developer Notes

### Avatar Upload Flow
1. User selects image file
2. Client validates file (type, size)
3. POSTs to `/api/profile/avatar` with FormData
4. Server uploads to Supabase Storage bucket
5. Server gets public URL
6. Server updates profile.avatar_url
7. Client updates UI

### Favorites Flow
1. User clicks favorite button
2. Component checks auth state
3. POSTs to `/api/favorites` with itemType + itemId
4. Server creates saved_favorites record
5. Trigger updates item's save_count
6. Client updates UI (heart icon)

### Profile Deletion Flow
1. User clicks "Delete Account"
2. Shows warning with bullet points
3. User confirms (double confirmation)
4. DELETEs to `/api/profile/delete`
5. Server cascade deletes:
   - Garage sales
   - Favorites
   - Knowledge submissions
   - Profile
   - Auth user (if service role available)
6. Client signs out and redirects to home

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Avatar Storage**
   - Requires Supabase Storage bucket setup
   - Gracefully falls back to initials if storage not configured

2. **Account Deletion**
   - Auth user deletion requires service role key
   - Profile deletion still works with anon key
   - User won't be able to sign in after profile deletion

3. **Saved Items**
   - Currently supports garage-sales and articles
   - Events and businesses ready but not integrated yet
