- **Week 4:** 2 hours (evaluate)

**Total Phase 1: ~17 hours over 4 weeks** (manageable!)

### Distribution Strategy (Solo)
**Day 1 (Saturday):**
- Morning: Deploy 5 large posters (Tier 1) - 3 hours
- Afternoon: Set up 5 card holders - 1 hour

**Day 2 (Sunday):**
- Morning: Deploy 10 medium posters (Tier 2) - 3 hours
- Afternoon: Set up remaining 5 card holders - 1 hour

### Making It Easier

## 🎯 MY DECISION POINTS

### After Week 2 (Halfway Through Phase 1)
**Ask myself:**
- Are we getting scans? (Target: 100+)
- Are scans converting? (Target: 25+ users)
- Which 3 locations are killing it?
- Which 3 locations are duds?

**Action:** Optimize (move duds, restock winners)

### After Week 4 (End of Phase 1)
**Ask myself:**
- Did we hit 100 users? (Yes/No)
- What's our cost per user? (<$5 = good!)
- Are people talking about it? (Community buzz)
- Should we do Phase 2? (GO/NO-GO)

**If GO:** Order Phase 2 materials
**If NO-GO:** Optimize Phase 1 for another 4 weeks
