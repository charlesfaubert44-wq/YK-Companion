## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Design Phase
❌ QR codes too small (minimum 1.5" for posters, 1" for cards)
❌ Not testing QR codes before printing
❌ Low contrast (use black on white)
❌ Forgetting bleed area (0.125" around edges)

### Distribution Phase
❌ Posting without permission (builds bad reputation)
❌ Placing posters too high/low (5-6 feet is ideal)
❌ Forgetting to document placements (take photos!)
❌ Not checking back (posters fall, cards run out)

### Tracking Phase
❌ No analytics setup (flying blind!)
❌ Not tracking which locations perform best
❌ Ignoring underperformers (move or remove them)
❌ No weekly optimization (set and forget)
