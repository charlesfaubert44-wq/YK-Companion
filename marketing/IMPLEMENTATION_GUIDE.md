## 💡 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** QR codes not scanning
- **Solution:** Check lighting (too dark?), increase QR size, test print quality, regenerate at higher resolution

**Issue:** Low scan rate
- **Solution:** Better poster placement (eye level, high traffic), larger QR code, add "Scan me!" text, test different locations

**Issue:** High scans, low conversions
- **Solution:** Improve landing page, clearer value proposition, easier registration, check for broken links

**Issue:** Cards disappearing too fast
- **Solution:** Great! Restock more frequently, order more cards, track which locations to prioritize

**Issue:** Cards not moving at all
- **Solution:** Move to better location, hand out yourself, partner not engaged (replace partner), design issue (test new variant)

**Issue:** Permission denied for poster
- **Solution:** Try smaller size, offer to sponsor their bulletin board, emphasize "free community resource," move to next location

**Issue:** Partner not handing out cards
- **Solution:** Check in personally, retrain on pitch, provide incentive (track their referrals), replace with engaged partner
