## ‚ùå Never Implemented (From Old Documentation)

These features were in planning documents but never built:

### Trip Planner System

- **Accommodations Listings** - Hotel/lodging database
- **Itinerary Builder** - User-created trip plans
- **Booking System** - Integrated booking functionality
- **Reviews & Ratings** - User review system
- **Weather Cache** - Cached weather API data

**Why removed:** Project pivoted from trip planner to community platform

### Aurora Live Events (Extensive Version)
- **Real-time Photo Uploads** - Community aurora photography
- **Photo Mosaics** - Time-synchronized photo collages
- **Photography Challenges** - Monthly competitions with leaderboards
- **Achievement Badges** - User gamification (First Light, Aurora Master, etc.)
- **3-Day Aurora Forecasts** - KP predictions with hourly breakdown
- **Push Notifications** - Browser alerts for aurora events
- **Email Digests** - Customizable summaries (daily/weekly/monthly)
- **AR Camera Overlay** - Real-time camera settings based on KP
- **AI Photo Scoring** - Multi-dimensional quality analysis
- **Print Downloads** - High-resolution mosaic exports (4K/8K/12K)
- **WebSocket Real-time** - Live updates for events and photos

**Why removed:** Overly complex feature set, maintenance burden, shifted focus to simpler community tools

## üìä Feature Comparison

### Old Vision vs. Current Reality

| Feature Category | Old Plan | Current Reality |
|-----------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Core Focus** | Trip planning + Aurora tracking | Community platform + Premium ads |
| **Database Tables** | 20+ | 4 |
| **Main Features** | Activities, bookings, complex aurora system | Garage sales, premium spotlight, multilingual |
| **Monetization** | Booking commissions | Premium sponsor placements |
| **Complexity** | High (WebSocket, AI, AR) | Medium (Maps, scheduling, i18n) |
| **Target Users** | Tourists | Tourists + Residents + Newcomers |

## üéØ Why The Pivot?

### Problems with Old Approach:
1. **Too Complex** - Aurora Live Events had 10+ interconnected features
2. **High Maintenance** - Real-time systems, AI scoring, image processing
3. **Unclear Business Model** - No clear revenue path
4. **Scope Creep** - Feature bloat made development unsustainable
5. **Resource Intensive** - Needed significant infrastructure

### New Approach Benefits:
1. **Simpler** - 4 tables, clear features
2. **Revenue Model** - Premium Spotlight generates income
3. **Community Focused** - Garage sales serve real local need
4. **Maintainable** - Small codebase, easier to update
5. **International** - 9 languages attract global tourists

## üìÅ Archived Code

### Where to Find Old Code

**Old Database Schemas:**
- `docs/database-schema.md.old` - Original trip planner schema

**Old Component (Deleted):**
- `apps/web/src/components/DailyDadJoke.tsx` - ‚ùå Deleted

**Still Exists But Unused:**
- `apps/web/src/app/aurora-live/` - May be simplified/outdated
- `apps/web/src/app/pixel-demo/` - Demo page, not core feature

## üí° Lessons Learned

### What We Learned:
1. **Start Simple** - MVP approach works better than complex v1
2. **Revenue First** - Build monetization early (Premium Spotlight)
3. **Local Needs** - Garage sales were more valuable than complex aurora features
4. **Maintainability** - Simpler codebases are easier to sustain
5. **Focus** - Better to do 3 things well than 10 things poorly

### What We Kept:
- ‚úÖ Aurora information (simplified)
- ‚úÖ Garage sale mapping
- ‚úÖ Community focus
- ‚úÖ Northern branding
- ‚úÖ Mobile-first design

### What We Improved:
- ‚úÖ Added multilingual support (9 languages)
